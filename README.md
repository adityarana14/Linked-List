# Linked-List


Q1)  Given two numbers represented by two linked lists of size N and M. The task is to return a sum list. The sum list is a linked list representation of the addition of two input numbers from the last.


Q2) Given a singly linked list of size N of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.

Q3)  Given a singly linked list of N nodes. The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the output should be 3. If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the output should be 4.
